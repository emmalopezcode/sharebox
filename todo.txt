--------------------------------
test on ios
    - lost connection to device w camera
        - add just the image picker to the test file and see where it fails
    - duplicate plugin key FLTImagePickerPlugin
    - test the double tap functionality
    - test share
debug the popping issue
fix upload
 - when you would usually click on the page that takes you to upload
    - its a single page for selecting the picture
    - then that page pushes the image to the next page
    - check if you like it if not route back 
    - then pushes to text details then to final upload
