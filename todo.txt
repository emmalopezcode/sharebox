once you test the streamed data, test the save and return images w base64
test on ios
refactor the shit out of upload.dart 


search [and theres a lot: algolia, a few ui panels]

keep the doubles in wishlist from happening
    -create a list out of the data in the json
    -loop through with the equals function and then if it equals any of them dont put it in
    -also the inWishlist is a thing for the database to save
