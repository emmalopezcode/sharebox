# share_box

This is a project I intend to use to increase the positive economic, stylistic
and ecological outcomes of a system already in place at my college, Principia. 
The sharebox at Prin works like this: if you have a lamp, sweater, TV or anything
else that you are interested in getting rid of, simply leave it in the sharebox in the
basement of any of the houses or on the share-bench or other public areas. Then any other
needy party can collect it. Typically, at the end of either the semester or the year,
the area is cleaned out and donated to a facility. The Sharebox app simply digitizes the 
process, you can see any item that someone posts as they get rid of it, then go pick it up
at your leisure.
